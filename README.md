Howdy there, Colin McDonald speaking. I'm currently a senior undergraduate at the University of Notre Dame studying Computer Science and Philosophy. My broad research interests include programming languages, type theory, quantum computing, NLP, and formal logic. I'm particularly fascinated by dependent type systems, linear type systems, and characterizing effects in functional programming languages. I'm currently applying to PhD programs in computer science!
